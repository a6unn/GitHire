# Activity Thresholds Configuration
# Defines minimum activity levels and date ranges for BigQuery queries

# Minimum Events
# Threshold for considering a developer "active"
min_events:
  default: 10                 # Default minimum events in time period
  junior: 5                   # Lower threshold for junior roles
  mid_level: 10               # Standard threshold for mid-level
  senior: 20                  # Higher threshold for senior roles
  lead: 30                    # Highest threshold for tech leads/principals

# Date Ranges (in days)
# How far back to query GHArchive data
date_ranges:
  default: 30                 # Default lookback period (30 days)
  recent: 7                   # Very recent activity (last week)
  short: 14                   # Short-term activity (2 weeks)
  medium: 30                  # Medium-term activity (1 month)
  long: 90                    # Long-term activity (3 months)
  extended: 180               # Extended activity (6 months)

# Trending Detection Thresholds
trending:
  min_stars: 50               # Minimum stars gained to be considered "viral"
  star_velocity_threshold: 1.0  # Minimum stars per day
  min_viral_repos: 1          # Minimum viral repositories to qualify as trending
  early_adopter_days: 180     # Days after repo creation to consider "early adopter"

# Contribution Patterns
patterns:
  min_events_for_analysis: 5  # Minimum events needed to analyze patterns
  consistency_threshold: 0.6  # Threshold for "consistent" pattern (60% of days active)
  bursty_variance: 2.0        # Variance multiplier for "bursty" classification

# Repository Diversity
repository_diversity:
  min_unique_repos: 2         # Minimum repositories to show diversity
  single_repo_warning: true   # Warn if all activity in one repo

# Query Limits
query_limits:
  max_results: 1000           # Maximum candidates before enrichment
  trending_max_results: 500   # Maximum trending developers
  library_max_results: 1000   # Maximum library-specific developers

# Activity Quality Filters
quality_filters:
  exclude_bot_accounts: true  # Exclude accounts with "bot" in username
  exclude_fork_only: false    # Exclude developers who only fork (no original work)
  min_unique_repos: 1         # Minimum unique repositories contributed to

# Notes:
# - All thresholds can be overridden at query time
# - Adjust based on role seniority and job requirements
# - Lower thresholds for emerging technologies (fewer active developers)
# - Higher thresholds for common technologies (many active developers)
